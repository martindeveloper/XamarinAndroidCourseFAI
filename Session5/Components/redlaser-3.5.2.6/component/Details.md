RedLaser offers developers unparalleled flexibility in scan-screen design across platforms.

Using RedLaser, you can:

 - Change the scan overlay image
 - Add buttons and change the location of the buttons, including toggles
 - Add dynamic content based on the barcodes scanned
 - Play different sounds in response to scanned codes
 - Track barcodes as they move across the screen (or provide confirmation for densely packed barcodes)


## Supported Barcode Types

The RedLaser scanning SDK supports almost all major code types. We have intentionally disabled most of the supported code types in our app store application, since they arenâ€™t associated with store products. These codes can easily be enabled in our SDK.

- UPC-A
- UPC-E
- Codabar
- ITF / Code 25 (except Android)
- Code 39, 93, 128
